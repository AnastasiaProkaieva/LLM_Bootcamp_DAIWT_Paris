# MAGIC In this example we will load up a single pdf and ask questions and answers of it.
# MAGIC Most examples use OpenAI here we wil try out Llama v2.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Ours goal is twofold:
# MAGIC - Find a way to convert our source data into useful snippets that can be inserted into prompts as context
# MAGIC - To use our vector db to provide relevant chunks for use in our prompts
# MAGIC
# MAGIC <img src="https://files.training.databricks.com/images/icon_note_32.png" alt="Note">  The goal here is to get some sort of response not necessarily a good response. We will address that in later sections.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md We are going to the ```CharacterTextSplitter``` from LangChain to split this document. LangChain has many text splitters, see [here](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/#text-splitters) for a complete list. This splits only on one type of character (defaults to ```"\n\n"```).

# COMMAND ----------

# We will feed all pages in
# chunk_size is a key parameter.
# For more advanced use we may want to tune this or use a paragraph splitter or something else

# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Setup Chromadb
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We utilise the ```HuggingFaceEmbeddings()``` from LangChain which defaults to ```sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2``` to generate our text embeddings. However, note that Chroma can handle tokenization, embedding, and indexing automatically for you. If you would like to change the embedding model, read [here on how to do that](https://docs.trychroma.com/embeddings). You will need instantiate the ```collection``` yourself instead of using the LangChain wrapper.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC You can read the documentate [here](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/vectorstores/integrations/chroma) to learn more about how Chroma integrates with LangChain.

# COMMAND ----------

embeddings = HuggingFaceEmbeddings(model_name='sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2',
                                   model_kwargs={'device': 'cpu'})
docsearch = Chroma.from_documents(texts, embeddings)

# we can verify that our docsearch index has objects in it with this
print('The index includes: {} documents'.format(docsearch._collection.count()))

# COMMAND ----------

# We want to quickly verify as with the pace these libraries evolve, things can break often
query = "Does making language models bigger improve intent following?"

docs = docsearch.similarity_search(query)
print(docs[0].page_content)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Although we can get results from Chroma, it's often useful to metadata as well as ids to our partitions of texts (or embedding vectors). Often we don't want to query the entire vector database. This use-case is addressed below.

# COMMAND ----------

for i, t in enumerate(texts): 
  if i % 2:
    t.metadata = {"source": file_path}
  else:
    t.metadata = {"source": "Uknown"}

# COMMAND ----------

docsearch_metadata = (
  Chroma.from_documents(
    collection_name="single_paper",
    documents=texts,
    ids=[f"id{x}" for x in range(len(texts))],
    embedding=HuggingFaceEmbeddings()
  )
)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Now we can query the vector store and filter on a specific metadata condition

# COMMAND ----------

docs = (
  docsearch_metadata.similarity_search(
    query="What do we call models that use reinforcement learning with human feedback?",
    filter={"source": file_path})
)

print(f'Metadata of the document is: {docs[0].metadata}')
print(f'Some text from the returned page: "{docs[0].page_content[0:50]}"')

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md 
# MAGIC We can also query our Vector DB and retrieve a tuple of (result, score) so we can have a measure of confidence from the returned results. The returned value is a similarity score between the vector corresponding to the query and the vector for the returned document. Lower scores imply that the vectors are closer together and hence have higher relevance with the query vector.

# COMMAND ----------

docs = docsearch_metadata.similarity_search_with_score("What do we call models that use reinforcement learning with human feedback?")
scores = [d[1] for d in docs]

# MAGIC Inside that method, we can see that `load_qa_chain` is the function that generates the chain.
# MAGIC It is only by looking inside `load_qa_chain` can we work out the correct variable to use to override the prompt.
